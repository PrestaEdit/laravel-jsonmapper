Map any JSON String on to your PHP Objects. Tested with Laravel, but basically working with every PHP Framework that 
supports namespaces. 

This Plugin is based on the project from [@cweiske](https://github.com/cweiske). I added support primary for the Laravel Framework
and I will also develope additional features, especially for the Laravel Framework.

## Installation

__Via your terminal__ 
Paste the following line in your terminal and press enter. 

```
composer require prestaedit/laravel-jsonmapper
```

__Via your composer.json file__ 

Add the following line to your ```composer.json``` at the "require" section.
